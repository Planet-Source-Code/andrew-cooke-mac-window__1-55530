### Description

I did not make this VBP, it was made by Evan Toder, but as it so good i thought it deserved to be here. This really does look good, all i have done is modified it so that it is easier to undertsand. Plus i have marked out points where you should edit the project. Nothing else needed, just extract and run. Please read the Readme.txt as it will explain alot about the code.
